# Game-of-Pig
Two player dice based game against the computer player.

Variation: Big Pig

This refers to the style of Pig that will be played, as Big Pig includes two dice, and alters a couple methods of scoring.

**RULES**

Game is split into rounds with a winning score of 100.

Each turn 2 dice are rolled to begin and scoring is as follows:

`Double 1's` Turn Score +25, MUST roll again

`Doubles` Turn Score +2*(sum of doubles), MUST roll again

`1 and x` Turn Score SET TO 0, TURN IS OVER

`x and y` Turn Score +(x + y), CHOOSE to roll again OR end turn


**Computer Strategy**

In this edition of the game, the computer will randomly select to continue or end it's turn if required.

**How to Play**

To begin the first round (and all subsequent rounds), a stroke of the `Enter` key is required.

If the player must choose to continue or end a turn, the console will prompt an entry of either `y` or `n` to specify the player's choice.
